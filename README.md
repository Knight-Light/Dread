This game is my first project on the Unreal Editor. It is a Horror FPS game where the aim is to cross the level while surviving hordes of zombies.
Lets Start!

## Concept Outline
  So the basic storyline of the game is that a soldier with his battalion was ordered to check a park for suspicious activity. Upon further investigation it was revealed that a mutation spread through a nearby hospital, turning all the patients to mindless killing machines. By the time, the troop realised the imminent danger it was too late. Only one soldier was able to make it back to the edge of the park. Now, he is stuck on the entrance of a huge park arena which is infested with flesh eating zombies. He has to cross the humongous region on his own. No reinforcements are coming. No one is coming to save him. All he has for a companion is his AK-47 Rifle which has about a hundred bullets which will barely   suffice. On the other hand, the zombies have numbers on their side. As they prowl the grounds for their next victim, they change their positions on their own. They might not have a keen sense of sound but their sight doesnt waver, even in the dark. Will our soldier be able to make it out alive or is the dying of light indicate his end too?

 ## The Protagonist
 ![screenshot-www mixamo com-2021 08 22-10_59_04](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/78013524/130343585-71700cd0-2140-4008-a1bb-59426ffeea08.png)

 This is our protagonist a.k.a the soldier. As it can be clearly seen, he has a stealthy armour protecting him. This armour in the game is his first line of defence against the    horde. His armour has another great quality, it is regenerative. It takes damage from the enemy but also starts to regain its strength. The only downside is that it recovers at a fairly slow rate and it is prefered to escape and regain,rather than to lose health, which unlike the armour cannot regenerate.
 Our protagonist can run at a fairly high speed but if the player choses to sprint, he loses the ability to shoot while sprinting.
 In the dark expanse, he has a flashlight which comes in handy when fighting alone. It is very useful but has a low brightness, only illuminating a little of the surroundings. They also attract the attention of the zombies, so it must be used with caution.
 
 ## Zombies

All the inmates of the hospital now roam the park in the dark,waiting in silence. Due to the mutation, the zombies can hear very clearly and can be easily evaded. Their sight however is another matter entirely. These abominations can see to a large distance and can pursue their target to a fair amount of distance. All in all, it is better to resort to discretion with these creatures.

## Pickup Items
### 1. Rifle Ammo

The rifle ammo is the only thing that can help you fight back against the undead. Each of these contain a 100 bullets that may prove life saving in the game. It is in the shape of a magazine and can be clearly spotted because it glows with a blinding white light. To see it clearly the size has been enlarged so as to not miss these essentials

### 2.Painkillers

This is like a more Max Payne type concept.These are the life saving drugs that can replenish the health of the player. One pickups fills up the entire healthbar. These pickups are the only way to regain health lost in combat. Because of their importance, they are hard to come by.
